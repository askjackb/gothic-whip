# Gap / contradiction audit

Date: 2026-10-08. Scope: documents only — `SPEC.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/ANIMATION_SPEC.md`, `docs/ASSET_SPEC.md`, `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md`, `docs/VALIDATION.md`, `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md`, `templates/asset-manifest.example.json`. No game, engine project, or asset exists or was created for this audit.

Method: every shared number was traced to its single authoritative source and re-derived by hand; the manifest example was parsed as JSON; all relative Markdown links were resolved programmatically. Only checks actually performed are claimed below. Runtime behavior (import, playback, touch, performance) remains **NOT-TESTED** per [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md).

Severity key: **blocking-for-production** (must be resolved before building/shipping), **blocking-for-package** (blocks a named work package in [WORK_PACKAGES.md](WORK_PACKAGES.md)), **note** (recorded; proceeded on a marked proposal or harmless).

## A. Verified consistent (arithmetic shown)

**A1. Jump envelope — consistent.** SPEC §4 proposes initial jump velocity −640 u/s against gravity 1600 u/s², top speed 240 u/s.

- Time to apex = 640 / 1600 = **0.4 s** ✓ (SPEC: 0.4 s)
- Rise = 640² / (2 × 1600) = 409600 / 3200 = **128 u** ✓ (SPEC: 128 u)
- Same-height air time = 2 × 0.4 = 0.8 s; travel = 240 × 0.8 = **192 u** ✓ (SPEC: 192 u)
- SPEC's conservative stage limits sit inside the envelope: mandatory gap ≤ 112 u leaves 192 − 112 = **80 u headroom** (0.33 s at full speed); mandatory up-step ≤ 64 u is exactly **50% of the 128 u rise**; minimum landing platform 128 u = exactly 2 terrain modules on the proposed 64 u grid (D11). No contradiction.

**A2. Whip timeline — consistent across three documents.** SPEC §5: 150 ms anticipation + 100 ms active + 250 ms recovery = 500 ms. ASSET_SPEC §3 frame durations [75, 75, 50, 50, 62.5, 62.5, 62.5, 62.5]: frames 0–1 sum to **150** (anticipation), frames 2–3 to **100** (active), frames 4–7 to **250** (recovery), total **500 ms**. Active interval is therefore [150, 250) ms. The manifest example (`templates/asset-manifest.example.json`) parses as JSON, carries the identical duration list, declares `total_ms: 500` and `active_interval_ms: [150, 250]` — all three sources agree.

**A3. Crouch collision vs standing body — consistent.** ASSET_SPEC §2: standing body 40×104 centered (0, −52) → spans y [−104, 0]. ANIMATION_SPEC: crouch body 40×60 centered (0, −30) → spans y [−60, 0]. Widths identical (40 u); **foot origin y = 0 in both** — the crouch lowers only the top edge, exactly as ANIMATION_SPEC requires ("preserving the foot origin", "no shrinking the artwork or moving the origin downward"). The crouched whip band (SPEC §5: y −48..−20) lies inside the crouch span [−60, 0]; the standing band (y −82..−46) lies inside [−104, 0]. Note only: the crouched band is not a pure translation of the standing band (top edge 34 u lower, bottom edge 26 u lower; heights 36 u vs 28 u) — SPEC defines it as its own interval, so this is a definition, not a discrepancy.

**A4. Canvas / pivot / density arithmetic — consistent.** ASSET_SPEC §1: 512×512 source px at 2 px per game unit → 256×256 u canvas; hero height 112 u = 224 source px ✓. Whip canvas 768×512 with foot-origin anchor at source x 256 leaves (768 − 256) / 2 = **256 u of room to the right** of the origin; the SPEC hitbox reaches x +168 < 256 ✓ (left-facing mirrors around the same origin). Landing platform minimum (128 u, A1) equals 2 terrain modules ✓.

**A5. Knockdown cycle fits inside i-frames — consistent.** ANIMATION_SPEC clips: knockdown 6 × 60 ms = 360 ms; get_up 6 × 75 ms = 450 ms; full sequence 810 ms. SPEC §5 invulnerability is 1 s = 1000 ms ≥ 810 ms, so the hunter cannot be re-hit during get-up. [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) relies on this.

**A6. Links and review-record claims — re-verified.** All 18 relative Markdown links in the repo resolve (0 broken), confirming the 2026-10-07 review record's link claim. All numeric claims in `REVIEW_RECORD.md` (frame totals 113 + 24 = 137; 500 ms sum; active interval [150, 250)) re-derived and confirmed above.

## B. Contradictions, tensions, and gaps

**B1. Identity vs distribution rights — RESOLVED by user decision (2026-10-08).** *Was: blocking-for-production.*
As handed off, D02 confirmed "Simon Belmont in Castlevania's world" and D12 forbade substituting an original hunter, while D15 confirmed publication to a new public repository with a public web build and a later Android APK. A named Konami character and world cannot be licensed by this project, so no public build could ever ship under D02/D12 — the contradiction was total and could only be resolved by the user.
**Resolution (user, 2026-10-08):** "Switch to an original hunter (shippable)." The protagonist and world are now an **original hunter in an original gothic world**. Castlevania remains a design *reference* for tone and mechanics only — whip-led combat, restrained jump, dark gothic horror, no visible pixels (D03–D06 substance unchanged). [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) has been amended for D02/D12 accordingly.
*Follow-up edits required (enumerated when this audit was written; **completed by the B1 wording pass, 2026-10-08** — see REVIEW_RECORD "B1 wording consistency"; each file received its own consistency check in that pass):*
- `SPEC.md` §1 (two identity sentences) and §2 (signature moment naming Simon).
- `README.md` line 3 ("starring Simon Belmont…").
- `AGENTS.md` "Preserve confirmed user intent" bullet.
- `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md` "Visual grammar" paragraph (Simon/costume wording → original hunter design language).
- `docs/ASSET_SPEC.md` §2 and §3 ("shrinking Simon", "Simon's frame size").
- `prompts/ASSET_GENERATION.md` (identity paragraph + "approved Simon design reference" example) and `prompts/NEXT_LLM.md` (protagonist sentence).
- `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md` P0 row (D12 reframed: original hunter design reference is now a P2 deliverable; D13 is resolved).
- `docs/REVIEW_RECORD.md` "Open at publication" paragraph is a dated 2026-10-07 record and is **not** rewritten; it is superseded by the 2026-10-08 entry appended in this pass.

**B2. Texture budget: hero frames alone exceed the slice budget — RECONCILED ON PAPER in P3 (2026-10-08); unresolved in fact until measured.** *Was: blocking-for-package (P3, P5); remains blocking-for-production if still unreconciled at asset production.*
Recomputed: one 512×512 RGBA8 body frame = 1 MiB → 113 frames = **113 MiB**; one 768×512 whip frame = 1.5 MiB → 24 frames = **36 MiB**; hero total **149 MiB** against the ≤128 MiB whole-slice resident budget in [TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md](TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md) — **21 MiB (16.4%) over before any enemy, boss, terrain, UI, or background art**. Two aggravating factors: (a) the 128 MiB figure is stated "before mipmaps/overhead" — a 2048×2048 RGBA8 page is 16 MiB raw, ≈21.3 MiB with a full mip chain, so the budget buys at most six fully-mipmapped pages; (b) trimming transparent space will shrink the hero substantially, but no packed-occupancy number exists anywhere yet. ANIMATION_SPEC already flags this and forbids solving it by cutting action coverage.
**P3 reconciliation ([TEXTURE_BUDGET.md](TEXTURE_BUDGET.md)):** the full slice inventory (278.97 MiB untrimmed) under stated trim/packing assumptions needs 8 pages all-resident — 170.7 MiB mipmapped, 128.0 MiB without mips — so **the budget does not hold as written**. TEXTURE_BUDGET proposes the smallest contract change (no mip chains on slice art + peak-concurrency residency ≤7 pages, swap at the boss gate → 112.0 MiB peak, 16 MiB headroom), marked PROPOSED for P6/user ratification; neither ASSET_SPEC nor TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS numbers were edited. Sensitivity: trim factors 10 points worse break even the amended model (144 MiB), so the verdict must be re-measured on the first real packed art (VALIDATION V2/V8) before production proceeds.

**B3. D09 stomp/contact rule — still OPEN (user not answered).** *Note for now; blocking-for-package only if reversed after P1.*
DECISIONS D09 (PROPOSED, "Not answered by user") and SPEC §5 agree on the baseline — contact, including landing on an enemy, hurts the hunter; no stomp kills — but the user has never confirmed it. [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) is written against this baseline and marks it at every contact rule. If the user later wants stomp kills, the pursuer/swooper briefs, the enemy-contact rules, and VALIDATION V7's "reachable without … stomp kills" question all change. No other package depends on D09.

**B4. D14 device matrix — RESOLVED by user decision (2026-10-08), with P5 follow-ups.** *Was: blocking-for-package (P5).*
**Resolution (user, 2026-10-08):** the target device is **iPhone 17, browser play in iOS Safari**. Recorded in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). Consequences, all deferred to P5 (TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md is **not** rewritten in this pass):
- The proposed performance anchor "an agreed mid-range Android phone" (60 fps, 95th-percentile frame ≤20 ms, ≤30 MiB cold payload, ≤12 s load) is superseded: P5 must re-derive and re-anchor the device/browser matrix and every performance hypothesis on iPhone 17 / iOS Safari. Those numbers are currently unanchored hypotheses, not targets anyone has validated.
- iOS Safari is a **must-support** target, not an exploratory check; the D14 either/or is closed.
- The single-threaded web-export baseline (D10, PROPOSED) aligns well with Safari's constraints; P5 should still verify the pinned Godot version's WebGL2/WASM behavior on the actual device.
- Android APK remains DEFERRED (D16) and is unaffected by this resolution.

**B5. D13 horror intensity — RESOLVED by user decision (2026-10-08).** *Was: blocking-for-package (P2).*
**Resolution (user, 2026-10-08):** the proposed treatment is confirmed — dread, decay, silhouettes; **no explicit gore**. Recorded in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md). P2 (art bible) may now fix content limits against this line.

**B6. Knockback magnitude is nowhere specified — gap, filled by P1 proposal.** *Blocking-for-package (P4).*
SPEC §5 and ANIMATION_SPEC require animated knockback and give the clip length (4 × 75 ms = 300 ms) but no displacement or velocity in any document. Stage design (P4) cannot certify that a knockback on a minimum 128 u platform won't force a pit fall without a number. [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) proposes 160 u/s for 300 ms ≈ 48 u — less than the 64 u half-width of a minimum platform — as a **PROPOSED** value pending greybox playtest (VALIDATION V6).

**B7. Which boss hits are "heavy" is unspecified — gap, filled by P1 proposal.** *Note.*
SPEC §5 distinguishes ordinary damage (knockback) from "heavy boss hits" (knockdown + get-up), but never says which of the boss's two attacks (SPEC §3: one close-range, one ground hazard) is heavy. [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) proposes: close-range strike = heavy (knockdown); ground hazard = ordinary (knockback). All enemy hits cost 1 health either way (SPEC §5 prices only "ordinary contact" at one unit; the heavy/ordinary distinction is the *reaction*, and no document prices any hit above one unit).

**B8. Swooper hit-points ambiguous — gap, filled by P1 proposal.** *Note.*
SPEC §5: "one hit to kill basic enemies, two for the ranged enemy, and eight for the boss." The three archetypes (SPEC §3) are pursuer, swooper, ranged; §5 names only "basic" and "ranged". [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) reads "basic" as pursuer + swooper (1 HP each), the only reading that prices all three archetypes. Marked PROPOSED pending user confirmation alongside D07.

**B9. Respawn before the first checkpoint is undefined — gap, filled by P1.** *Note.*
SPEC §5 defines checkpoint restart (health + encounter state restored) but the stage has one checkpoint mid-stage (SPEC §3 beats) and says nothing about dying before reaching it. [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) defines the stage-start spawn as the default respawn until the checkpoint is touched.

**B10. Enemy inside the whip dead zone — gap, filled by P1.** *Note.*
The whip's active region starts at x +40; no document states what resolves an enemy that closes inside 40 u. P1 rule (proposal): contact damage + knockback separates hunter and attacker, and the 1 s i-frames prevent an instant re-trigger, so the dead zone can never soft-lock a fight.

**B11. Stale identity wording outside DECISIONS.md — RESOLVED by the B1 wording pass (2026-10-08).**
Separate from B1's resolution: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md`, `docs/ASSET_SPEC.md`, and both files under `prompts/` previously instructed future contributors to preserve "Simon Belmont in Castlevania's world" (enumerated in B1). That pass is now made: a grep over the seven files finds "Simon" only in `prompts/NEXT_LLM.md`, describing the superseded interview-era identity. All seven files now present the original-hunter identity, with Castlevania as design reference for tone/mechanics only.

**B12. Transfer size vs resident size — note, no contradiction.**
TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS pairs a ≤30 MiB *transferred* cold-cache payload with the ≤128 MiB *resident* RGBA budget. These measure different things (compressed download vs decoded GPU memory) and do not conflict; P5 should keep both and state the decompression assumption explicitly. Recorded so a future reader doesn't "fix" either number.

## C. Open items left for the user

1. **D09** — confirm the no-stomp baseline (contact hurts, including landing on an enemy), or request stomp kills and a P1 revision.
2. **D07–D11** — the slice shape, control scheme, engine baseline, view/grid/density numbers all remain PROPOSED; [GAMEPLAY_RULES.md](GAMEPLAY_RULES.md) is written against them and needs confirmation before it can be treated as settled (its values change nothing the user has confirmed).
3. Everything in B2 (texture residency) and the B4 follow-ups (iPhone 17 performance matrix) is specification work for P3/P5 — no user input needed, but no production art or build should start until both close.
