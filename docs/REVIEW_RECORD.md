# Initial handoff review

Date: 2026-10-07. Scope: documents and examples only.

## Completed checks

- All 18 relative Markdown file links in the initial 16-file handoff resolve.
- The example asset manifest parses as JSON.
- The eight example attack-frame durations sum to 500 ms, matching the gameplay and asset contracts; active interval is [150, 250) ms.
- The proposed hero animation table totals 113 body frames plus 24 weapon frames (137 total).
- Untrimmed frame memory is explicitly reconciled as a budget conflict to solve before production: 113 MiB body + 36 MiB weapon exceeds the 128 MiB slice-art target.
- Final interview direction is reflected throughout: primarily Castlevania, no visible pixels, full supported-action animation. Earlier Mario/crossover brainstorming is not a production commitment.
- No existing workspace project, third-party art binary, game implementation, or generated asset was copied into this repository.

## Explicitly not tested

Engine import, sprite quality, animation playback, combat behavior, mobile touch controls, browser export, performance, loading, and Android APK. No implementation or assets exist to test.

## Open at publication

The final identity answer is confirmed: Simon Belmont in Castlevania’s world. Exact costume reference, horror intensity, target hardware, and proposed numerical tuning remain for later specification work. No further interview is required to use this handoff.

# Follow-up review — audit + P1 gameplay rules

Date: 2026-10-08. Scope: documents only. This entry appends to, and where noted supersedes, the 2026-10-07 record above; the original entry is retained unedited as history.

## Completed checks

- Cross-document audit written to `docs/AUDIT.md`. All shared numbers re-derived and consistent: jump envelope (640/1600 → 0.4 s apex, 128 u rise, 192 u same-height travel; SPEC's 112 u gap / 64 u step limits sit inside it); whip frame durations [75,75,50,50,62.5,62.5,62.5,62.5] sum to SPEC's 150/100/250 ms phases, 500 ms total, active interval [150, 250) ms; crouch body 40×60 centered (0, −30) vs standing 40×104 centered (0, −52) share the y=0 foot origin; knockdown + get-up (360 + 450 = 810 ms) fits inside the 1 s invulnerability.
- The manifest example still parses as JSON and matches the contracts; all relative Markdown links in the repo were re-resolved programmatically (18 checked, 0 broken before this pass's additions; re-checked after, see commit).
- `docs/GAMEPLAY_RULES.md` (Package P1) completed as a fully PROPOSED baseline: hero state-transition table covering every ANIMATION_SPEC state with interruption priority, input rules (100 ms coyote/buffer, opposing-input neutral, fresh-press whip, focus-loss input clear), damage/knockback/knockdown rules, all crouch-clearance cases, pit/death/checkpoint/retry cases, and briefs for the ground pursuer, airborne swooper, stationary ranged threat, and two-attack boss — each with timing windows shown arithmetically compatible with the 500 ms whip timeline and 128 u jump rise, at SPEC hit-points (1/2/8).
- Three user decisions dated 2026-10-08 recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (Amendments section, ledger resolve format): D02/D12 superseded — protagonist and world are an **original hunter in an original gothic world** (Castlevania retained as design reference only); D13 confirmed — dread, decay, silhouettes, **no explicit gore**; D14 confirmed — target device **iPhone 17 / iOS Safari** (must-support). D09 and all other entries untouched.
- The identity contradiction (D02/D12 vs the public distribution confirmed in D15) is therefore closed. Remaining audit items are an unresolved texture-budget reconciliation (hero frames 149 MiB untrimmed vs the 128 MiB slice budget — P3/P5) and a list of wording follow-ups in SPEC/README/AGENTS/ART_DIRECTION/ASSET_SPEC/prompts that this pass deliberately did not edit (AUDIT B1/B11); TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS' Android-phone performance anchor is superseded in substance and owed a P5 rewrite, also not edited here.

## Explicitly not tested

Everything from the 2026-10-07 list still stands: engine import, sprite quality, animation playback, combat behavior, mobile touch controls, browser export, performance, loading, and Android APK. The iPhone 17 / iOS Safari target (D14) has no device evidence yet; VALIDATION gates V1–V9 all remain PENDING. No implementation or assets exist to test.

## Open after this pass

- D09 (stomp kills vs the contact-hurts baseline) is the only remaining user question; P1 proceeds on the proposed baseline.
- D07–D11 remain PROPOSED; `docs/GAMEPLAY_RULES.md` and its [P1 proposal] values need user confirmation or greybox evidence before being treated as settled.
- Follow-up packages unblocked in sequence: wording consistency pass (B1 list), P2 art bible (identity reference now creatable; D13 line fixed), P3 asset briefs with a packed texture-occupancy table (B2), P5 technical/export design anchored on iPhone 17 Safari (B4).
