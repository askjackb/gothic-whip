# Gameplay rules — Package P1

**Status: PROPOSED baseline in full.** Nothing in this document is user-confirmed. It is written against the PROPOSED slice (D07), control scheme (D08), no-stomp contact rule (D09, user not yet answered), engine baseline (D10), and view/grid numbers (D11), using the confirmed requirements only for scope boundaries (D01, D03–D06, D18). Enemy names and appearances remain open (SPEC §3); the hero is referred to generically as **the hunter**. Values sourced from SPEC.md, [ANIMATION_SPEC.md](ANIMATION_SPEC.md), and [ASSET_SPEC.md](ASSET_SPEC.md) are quoted with their source; every value invented here is marked **[P1 proposal]** and needs user confirmation or greybox playtest evidence (VALIDATION V6) before it is treated as settled.

All runtime behavior described here is **NOT-TESTED**: no implementation exists. This document is the paper proof that the proposed rules, enemy behaviors, and geometry are mutually compatible; [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) gates V5–V7 remain pending.

## 2. Interruption priority

From ANIMATION_SPEC, formalized. When several events arrive in the same step, resolve in this order:

1. **Lethal damage** — a damage event (outside invulnerability) that reduces health to 0. Enters `death` from any state. Damage arriving during invulnerability is dropped entirely, so lethal damage can never occur inside the 1 s window. Falling past the stage kill plane is not damage and bypasses invulnerability (see §7).
2. **Nonlethal damage / knockdown** — interrupts anything below, including a committed attack: the outgoing whip hitbox deactivates in the same step (SPEC §4).
3. **Committed attack or heavy recovery** — an attack already started, `knockdown`, or `get_up`. Accepts no interruption except priority 1–2; in practice knockdown/get_up run inside the invulnerability window (810 ms < 1000 ms, AUDIT A5), so they are uninterrupted.
4. **Airborne movement** — `jump_takeoff`, `jump_rise`, `jump_apex`, `fall`, `attack_air`. Landing exits downward in priority, never upward into a ground state mid-frame.
5. **Crouch** — `crouch_enter`, `crouch_idle`, `crouch_exit`, `attack_crouch`.
6. **Grounded movement / idle** — `walk`, `start_move`, `stop_move`, `turn`, `land`, `idle`, `attack_ground`.

Worked combinations:

- **Whip press + jump press, same step, grounded:** the attack starts (priority 3 commitment); the jump press is buffered and expires after 100 ms — the attack runs 500 ms, so no jump occurs. (SPEC §4: jump during a grounded attack obeys the buffer and otherwise expires.)
- **Whip press, airborne:** `attack_air`; trajectory is preserved and no jump is possible (no double jump in this slice, SPEC §4).
- **Damage + whip press, same step:** damage wins (priority 2); the attack never starts and its hitbox never activates.
- **Direction reversal during an attack:** facing is locked until recovery ends (SPEC §4); the reversal is evaluated only after the attack completes, then routes through `turn`.
- **Crouch press during an attack:** ignored until the attack ends; if crouch is still held at that point, `crouch_enter` begins.
- **Landing during `attack_air`:** elapsed combat time and the per-target hit IDs carry over; the body clip switches to the corresponding grounded pose **without restarting the active window** (ANIMATION_SPEC). If the attack's 500 ms ends mid-air instead, play simply continues into the air states.

## 3. Input rules

- Horizontal: left/right from touch buttons or arrows/A–D (SPEC §4). **Opposing inputs resolve to neutral** — neither direction is stored.
- Jump: Space / jump button. Valid while grounded or within 100 ms coyote after leaving ground; a press up to 100 ms before becoming valid is buffered. Fixed height: button duration never changes the jump. No midair reversal: air steering is limited correction toward input × 240 u/s **[P1 proposal: horizontal acceleration 600 u/s² in air, so a full +240 → −240 reversal takes 0.8 s and can never exceed top speed]**.
- Whip: J / whip button. **A fresh press is required** — holding never re-triggers (SPEC §4). A press during an ongoing attack is discarded (no whip buffering) **[P1 proposal]**; a press during `land` interrupts the land clip (ANIMATION_SPEC).
- Crouch: dedicated button / down / S, held. Grounded only; there is no air-crouch state and no crouch-walk (SPEC §4). Move input while crouched is ignored.
- Simultaneous move + jump + whip must register together (SPEC §4, VALIDATION V5).
- **Focus loss, touch cancellation, or pause clears all held inputs**; on resume, nothing is held until freshly pressed (SPEC §4, §6). Pause freezes the simulation, including any in-flight attack timeline **[P1 proposal]**.
- All input is locked during `death`, checkpoint restart, and stage completion.

## 4. Hero state-transition table

Clip names and frame counts are ANIMATION_SPEC's proposed budget; durations at its stated per-frame rates. "Damage →" means the priority-2 routing of §5 (which of `hurt_recoil` / `knockback` / `knockdown` applies), and lethal damage routes any row to `death`.

| State | Enter when | Behavior | Exit to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `idle` (8f loop) | Spawn; `land`/`stop_move`/`crouch_exit` completes with no move input | Stationary; breathing loop | Move → `start_move`; jump → `jump_takeoff`; whip → `attack_ground`; crouch held → `crouch_enter`; walks off ground edge → `fall` |
| `start_move` (3f, 150 ms) | Move input from `idle` | Horizontal motion begins immediately; clip is visual only | Completes or input released → `walk` / `stop_move`; jump/whip/crouch as `idle` |
| `walk` (10f loop, playback tuned to travel speed) | Moving grounded | Up to 240 u/s toward input | Input released → `stop_move`; opposite input → `turn`; jump → `jump_takeoff`; whip → `attack_ground` (horizontal movement stops for the attack); crouch → `crouch_enter`; ground ends → `fall` |
| `stop_move` (3f, 150 ms) | Move input released | Decelerating settle; new input interrupts (ANIMATION_SPEC) | Completes → `idle`; new input → `start_move`; jump/whip/crouch as `idle` |
| `turn` (3f, 150 ms) | Direction input opposes facing while grounded, not attacking | Facing flips at the clip's explicit midpoint event; hitbox never sweeps the rear (ANIMATION_SPEC) | Completes → `walk` if input held, else `idle`; jump/whip interrupt as `idle` |
| `crouch_enter` (4f, 200 ms) | Crouch held while grounded and not attacking | Collision swaps 40×104 → 40×60 at entry **[P1 proposal: swap at entry, so ducking under a descending threat works from the press]** | Completes → `crouch_idle`; crouch released mid-enter → clearance check (§6) |
| `crouch_idle` (6f loop) | `crouch_enter` completes; or exit blocked (§6) | Stationary; move input ignored | Crouch released + clearance → `crouch_exit`; blocked → stays; whip → `attack_crouch`; jump → §6 case 3 |
| `crouch_exit` (4f, 200 ms) | Crouch released **and** standing clearance exists | Plays only with clearance (ANIMATION_SPEC); collision restores to 40×104 at completion **[P1 proposal]** | Completes → `idle`, or `start_move` if move held |
| `jump_takeoff` (3f, 120 ms) | Jump press grounded / in coyote / buffered on landing | vy = −640 applied in the entry step, not after the clip (ANIMATION_SPEC) | → `jump_rise` |
| `jump_rise` (4f) | Rising with vy < −160 **[P1 proposal: velocity-region boundary]** | Gravity; limited air correction (§3) | vy ≥ −160 → `jump_apex`; ceiling contact → vy = 0, `fall`; whip → `attack_air`; ground → `land` |
| `jump_apex` (3f) | −160 ≤ vy ≤ +160 **[P1 proposal]** | Weight-transition region around the 0.4 s apex | vy > +160 → `fall`; whip → `attack_air`; ground → `land` |
| `fall` (4f loop) | vy > +160; stepped off a ledge (no takeoff clip); ceiling cut ascent | Gravity; never adds world translation (ANIMATION_SPEC) | Ground → `land`; whip → `attack_air`; past kill plane → §7 pit sequence |
| `land` (4f, 160 ms) | Ground contact from `jump_rise`/`jump_apex`/`fall` | Compression/recovery; jump and attack interrupt immediately (ANIMATION_SPEC); move input interrupts into `start_move` **[P1 proposal]** | Completes → `idle`/`walk` by input; crouch held on landing → `crouch_enter` after the clip **[P1 proposal]** |
| `attack_ground` (8f, 500 ms) | Whip press, grounded, not crouched | Horizontal velocity 0; facing locked; hitbox live only in [150, 250) ms at x +40..+168, y −82..−46; ≤1 hit per target per attack | Completes → `idle`/`walk` by input (reversal routes via `turn`); damage → §5 (hitbox off same step) |
| `attack_air` (8f, 500 ms) | Whip press airborne | Trajectory preserved; no extra jump height; same timeline/hitbox relative to the foot pivot | Completes → current air state by velocity; landing → grounded continuation (§2); damage → §5 |
| `attack_crouch` (8f, 500 ms) | Whip press from `crouch_idle` **[P1 proposal: also from completed `crouch_enter`]** | Hitbox y −48..−20 (x unchanged); lowered whip socket | Completes → `crouch_idle` if crouch held, else §6 clearance check → `crouch_exit`/`crouch_idle`; damage → §5 |
| `hurt_recoil` (4f, 200 ms) | Non-displacing damage while grounded (rule in §5) | Attack cancelled; control locked | Completes → `idle` (or `fall` if ground vanished beneath) |
| `knockback` (4f, 300 ms) | Displacing damage (§5) | Physical slide, §5 values; articulated reaction, never translation-only (ANIMATION_SPEC) | Completes grounded → `idle`; displaced off ground / still airborne → `fall` |
| `knockdown` (6f, 360 ms) | Heavy hit (§5); airborne heavy hit lands with the knockdown flag set | Heavy-impact fall to ground contact; uninterrupted (inside i-frames) | → `get_up` |
| `get_up` (6f, 450 ms) | `knockdown` completes | Foot/ground alignment preserved; no input except pause | → `idle`; damage impossible (i-frames, §5) |
| `death` (10f, 800 ms) | Health reaches 0 (any state) | Full collapse; airborne lethal damage keeps falling and the collapse plays on ground contact (ANIMATION_SPEC); final pose holds | → §7 restart flow |

Whip overlay clips `whip_ground` / `whip_air` / `whip_crouch` (8f each) run synchronized to the three attack states on the separate weapon layer, hand-socket anchored per ASSET_SPEC §2; the whip layer has no blank frame during the active window (ANIMATION_SPEC). Every state above maps to exactly one ANIMATION_SPEC clip, and every clip is reachable — the state-inventory half of ANIMATION_SPEC's completeness proof.

## 5. Damage, knockback, knockdown, death

- **Taking a hit.** A damage event lands only outside the 1 s invulnerability window. It costs **1 health** (ordinary and heavy alike — AUDIT B7), starts invulnerability immediately (non-strobing tint), cancels any attack and deactivates its hitbox in the same step, and routes by hit class:
  - **Non-displacing** (ranged projectile) while grounded → `hurt_recoil` (200 ms, control locked).
  - **Displacing** (enemy contact, boss ground hazard, any hit while airborne) → `knockback`: horizontal impulse **160 u/s away from the source for the 300 ms clip ≈ 48 u** displacement **[P1 proposal — AUDIT B6]**, gravity normal. 48 u is less than half of a minimum 128 u landing platform (64 u), so a centered knockback cannot by itself push the hunter off a minimum platform. If the slide leaves the ground or ends airborne → `fall`.
  - **Heavy** (boss close-range strike, §9.4) → `knockdown` (360 ms) then `get_up` (450 ms). If a heavy hit lands airborne, knockback physics applies with a knockdown flag; the knockdown clip plays on ground contact.
  - **Lethal** (health reaches 0) → `death` (§4), overriding all of the above; lethal damage can never enter `get_up`.
- **Enemy contact** (baseline D09, unconfirmed): touching an enemy body — including landing on top of one — is a displacing hit on the hunter. There are no stomp kills. Contact also resolves the whip dead zone (AUDIT B10): the knockback separation plus i-frames guarantee the hunter can always re-establish the 40 u spacing.
- **Dealing a hit.** The whip hitbox is live only during [150, 250) ms of an attack, is defined by SPEC §5 geometry (never by sprite pixels), and strikes each target **at most once per attack** (per-attack hit ID, persisting across the air→ground continuation in §2). A hit enemy takes 1 damage and enters its hurt reaction, which interrupts its attack anticipation (boss exception in §9.4).

## 6. Crouch-clearance cases

Standing clearance = at least 104 u of free height above the foot origin (the standing body, ASSET_SPEC §2). Checked continuously, resolved per case:

1. **Release crouch, clearance exists** → `crouch_exit` → stand.
2. **Release crouch, no clearance** → remain in `crouch_idle`; the 40×60 body is kept and the check repeats. The hunter never pops into a ceiling.
3. **Jump pressed while crouched** → exits into a normal jump *only with standing clearance* (SPEC §4): clearance restores the standing body and `jump_takeoff` fires. Without clearance the jump is denied; the press sits in the 100 ms buffer and expires harmlessly (clearance cannot change while stationary).
4. **Damage while crouched** → §5 routing, but the collision body stays 40×60 through `knockback`/`hurt_recoil` until clearance exists **[P1 proposal]**, so a hit in a low passage can't force a stand-up into the ceiling.
5. **Attack from crouch** → `attack_crouch` with the lowered hitbox; afterwards case 1/2 logic decides standing.
6. **Moving into a low ceiling while standing** is ordinary collision blocking (the 104 u body doesn't fit); the hunter must crouch *before* the passage. There is no auto-crouch and no crouch-walk, so a low passage is traversed only if its far side is reachable stationary-crouched or by level design — P4 stage design owns passage placement.
7. **Landing with crouch held** → `land` plays, then `crouch_enter` (§4).

## 7. Failure, checkpoint, retry, completion

- **Pit fall.** Crossing the stage kill plane: `fall` continues, then a visible fade/death transition (ANIMATION_SPEC: no ground-collapse clip on a nonexistent floor) → restart at the current respawn point. A pit is not damage — it bypasses invulnerability and costs no health before the restart.
- **Respawn point.** Stage start until the checkpoint is touched (AUDIT B9); touching the checkpoint (overlap, with its activation indicator from ASSET_SPEC §5) moves the respawn there.
- **Death.** `death` clip completes and the final pose holds **[P1 proposal: 500 ms]** → restart at the respawn point.
- **Restart** (death, pit, or explicit retry) restores health to 5 and resets encounter state — enemies and the boss return to initial state, and a boss-unlocked exit re-locks (SPEC §5). Animation, combat, and input state are fully reset (ANIMATION_SPEC).
- **Boss / completion.** Defeating the boss unlocks the exit (SPEC §5); touching the exit enters the stage-complete state. An explicit retry is available after death and after completion (SPEC §5); retry from completion restarts the whole stage **[P1 proposal: from the stage-start spawn with the checkpoint reset]**.
- No limited lives, no score requirement, no save persistence in this slice (SPEC §5).

## 8. Enemy and boss briefs

General rules for all four: every hit the enemy lands costs the hunter 1 health (§5); every creature has complete idle/locomotion, attack anticipation, execution, recovery, hurt, and death animation — no static substitutes, and fliers articulate flight (ANIMATION_SPEC "Enemies and boss"). Sizes below are **[P1 proposal]** bands for P3 to finalize per-brief; names/appearances are open (SPEC §3). All four are beatable with the base whip and base jump — shown per brief.

### 8.1 Ground pursuer — basic, 1 HP

- **Behavior:** patrols its platform at **[P1 proposal]** 60 u/s; when the hunter is on the same level within **[P1 proposal]** 400 u, `alert` (300 ms rearing tell) then approaches at **[P1 proposal]** 100 u/s; within **[P1 proposal]** 120 u, a 350 ms wind-up tell, then a lunge at **[P1 proposal]** 260 u/s; 600 ms recovery after a lunge, hit or miss. Contact at any time is a displacing hit (§5).
- **Why the hunter wins (math):** the whip is live at x +40..+168 while contact needs roughly x < 40. Crossing that 128 u band at 100 u/s takes **1.28 s = 2.56 whip cycles** (500 ms each), so the hunter gets at least two full attacks before contact is possible. One hit kills (1 HP). The lunge is dodgeable by jumping: at 0.25 s after takeoff the hunter's feet are 640×0.25 − 800×0.25² = **110 u** up, clearing a ground body proposed at ~56 u tall; and a whip pressed at the wind-up tell is active at 150 ms, while the lunge needs (120−20)/260 ≈ 0.38 s to arrive — the strike lands first.
- **Animation coverage:** idle, patrol walk, `alert`, approach walk (distinct gait **[P1 proposal]**), lunge wind-up, lunge, recovery, hurt, death.

### 8.2 Airborne swooper — basic, 1 HP (AUDIT B8)

- **Behavior:** patrols on an articulated flight path at **[P1 proposal]** 175–190 u altitude above the ground lane; telegraphs a dive (600 ms **[P1 proposal]**: hover, wing-fold pose, audio cue) then dives through the hunter's lane, bottoming at **[P1 proposal]** 46–82 u above the ground before climbing out; 900 ms recovery climb **[P1 proposal]**. Contact during the dive is a displacing hit.
- **Reachable-window proof (math):** standing whip covers y 46..82 u above the hunter's feet — the dive's low pass sits exactly in that band while crossing x +40..+168 horizontally at **[P1 proposal]** 300 u/s, i.e. 128/300 ≈ **430 ms inside the band** against a 100 ms active window: the hunter times one press (150 ms anticipation) inside a ~330 ms effective window. Alternatively, a jump (rise 128 u) puts the foot pivot at 128 u at the 0.4 s apex, so the air whip's band covers **174..210 u** above the takeoff ground — the swooper's 175–190 u patrol altitude is inside it, and a full jump's 0.8 s air time brackets the pass. No double jump, stomp, or agile move is needed; SPEC §3's "reachable attack window" is satisfied two ways.
- **Animation coverage:** idle/perch, cruise flight (wing articulation), dive telegraph, dive, recovery climb, hurt, death (falling).

### 8.3 Stationary ranged threat — 2 HP

- **Behavior:** rooted. `aim` telegraph **[P1 proposal]** 900 ms (aiming pose tracks the hunter, visible charge cue), `fire` (one projectile), `recover` **[P1 proposal]** 700 ms, repeat. Projectile: **[P1 proposal]** 280 u/s, flies in the y −70..−95 band above its ground (i.e., above the 60 u crouch top, through the 104 u standing body), dissipates after **[P1 proposal]** 640 u. Contact with the body is a displacing hit.
- **Why the hunter wins (math):** the projectile band passes *over* a crouched hunter (top edge −60) and *through* a standing one — crouch is a complete dodge, and a jump also clears it once the feet pass ~95 u (reached at ≈0.19 s: 640t − 800t² = 95 → t ≈ 0.19 s). Between shots the cycle is 900 + 700 = **1600 ms**, during which the hunter advances 240 × 1.6 = **384 u** unopposed; two whip hits (2 HP) at 500 ms per grounded strike close the fight. Projectile hits are non-displacing (`hurt_recoil`, §5), so a hit never knocks the hunter out of approach range unfairly.
- **Animation coverage:** idle (breathing), aim, fire, recover, hurt (interrupts aim — §5), death. Stationary ≠ static (ANIMATION_SPEC).

### 8.4 Boss — 8 HP, two attacks

- **Behavior:** grounded, advances slowly toward the hunter at **[P1 proposal]** 70 u/s, turns only through a telegraphed turn. Two attacks, separately readable (ANIMATION_SPEC):
  - **Close-range strike (heavy → knockdown):** triggers within **[P1 proposal]** 150 u; 700 ms wind-up tell, strike, then **1100 ms recovery [P1 proposal]**. The strike threatens **[P1 proposal]** the 100 u in front of the boss — inside the hunter's 168 u whip reach, so spacing beats it.
  - **Ground hazard (ordinary → knockback):** 1200 ms telegraphed marked zone **[P1 proposal: 160 u wide]** at the hunter's position, then 400 ms eruption **[P1 proposal: height ≤ 46 u]**, then recovery.
- **Why the hunter wins (math):** the strike's 700 ms tell exceeds the hunter's full 500 ms whip commitment, so even a whip started the instant the tell begins recovers 200 ms before impact. The 1100 ms recovery fits **two full whip cycles** (2 × 500 ms) — a guaranteed punish. The hazard's 1200 ms signal gives 240 × 1.2 = **288 u** of walking escape from a 160 u zone, or a jump: the hunter's feet are above 46 u from t ≈ 0.08 s to t ≈ 0.72 s (**640 ms** of clearance vs the 400 ms eruption). Eight hits at roughly one per attack cycle **[P1 proposal estimate]** puts the fight near a minute of play — to be tuned by playtest, not by this document.
- **Animation coverage:** idle, locomotion, turn, strike anticipation/execution/recovery, hazard anticipation/execution/recovery, hurt (brief flinch **[P1 proposal: 200 ms; boss execution is not interrupted by hurt once the strike itself is live]**), complete death sequence. Defeat triggers the exit unlock (§7).

## 9. What remains open after P1

- D09 (stomp) and the D07–D11 baselines need user confirmation; every **[P1 proposal]** above needs the same or greybox evidence.
- Asset-level work (per-brief canvases, pivots, sockets, packed texture occupancy against AUDIT B2) is P3; stage geometry certification against the 112 u gap / 64 u step envelope and the 48 u knockback is P4; the iPhone 17 Safari device/performance matrix (AUDIT B4) is P5.
