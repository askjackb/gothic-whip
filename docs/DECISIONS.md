# Decision ledger

Captured from the scope interview on 2026-10-07. Only the user can confirm user intent; proposals below remain proposals unless accepted later.

| ID | Status | Decision / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D01 | CONFIRMED | 2D; Godot; web playable; mobile target; Android APK later. |
| D02 | SUPERSEDED 2026-10-08 | Final identity answer: Simon Belmont in Castlevania’s world, fighting with his whip. — **Superseded by user decision 2026-10-08: original hunter in an original gothic world (shippable); Castlevania remains a design reference for tone/mechanics only. See Amendments.** |
| D03 | CONFIRMED | Platformer with restrained jumping rather than highly agile Mario movement. |
| D04 | CONFIRMED | Gothic, dark-themed, highly detailed horror world; this supersedes the assistant's bright-world proposal. |
| D05 | CONFIRMED | Final answer: “no visible pixel.” Use non-pixel illustrated art; Octopath can inform lighting/depth, not pixel sprites. |
| D06 | CONFIRMED | Final direction: “actually mostly Castlevania, more of that.” Castlevania is the primary design/world reference; no Mario content is required in the initial scope. |
| D07 | CONFIRMED (baseline) 2026-10-08 | One hero, one 3–5 minute stage, three enemy archetypes, one boss, one checkpoint. — **Confirmed as tunable baseline under user-delegated judgement 2026-10-08. See Amendments (R3).** |
| D08 | CONFIRMED (baseline) 2026-10-08 | Landscape mobile with left/right/jump/whip/crouch controls, fixed-height jump, limited air steering. — **Confirmed as tunable baseline under user-delegated judgement 2026-10-08. See Amendments (R3).** |
| D09 | CONFIRMED 2026-10-08 | Contact hurts; no stomp kills. — **Resolved by user 2026-10-08: "no stomp. whip is the weapon." See Amendments.** |
| D10 | CONFIRMED (baseline) 2026-10-08 | Godot 4, GDScript, Compatibility renderer, single-threaded web export baseline; exact stable version to be pinned by the technical-spec contributor. — **Pinned to Godot 4.7.2-stable in TECHNICAL_SPEC.md; confirmed as baseline under user-delegated judgement 2026-10-08. See Amendments (R3).** |
| D11 | CONFIRMED (baseline) 2026-10-08 | 1280×720 logical view, 64-unit terrain grid, 112-unit standing hero height, 2× source art density. — **Confirmed as tunable baseline under user-delegated judgement 2026-10-08. See Amendments (R3).** |
| D12 | SUPERSEDED 2026-10-08 | Exact Simon incarnation, costume, and canonical reference design. Character/world identity itself is confirmed under D02; do not substitute an original hunter/world. — **Superseded 2026-10-08 with D02: replaced by an original hunter design reference, to be created as a P2 (art bible) deliverable. See Amendments.** |
| D13 | CONFIRMED 2026-10-08 | Horror intensity: atmosphere/body horror/gore limits and intended audience. Proposed initial treatment: dread, decay, silhouettes; no explicit gore pending direction. — **Resolved by user 2026-10-08: the proposed treatment is confirmed ("that's fine, no need heavier"). See Amendments.** |
| D14 | CONFIRMED 2026-10-08 | Minimum Android hardware and browser versions; whether iOS Safari is a supported target or exploratory check. — **Resolved by user 2026-10-08: target device is iPhone 17, browser play in iOS Safari (must-support, not exploratory). See Amendments.** |
| D15 | CONFIRMED | Current work is scope, prompt/framework, and asset instructions/specification; publish to a new public repository; other LLMs fill in details. |
| D16 | DEFERRED | Native Android APK build and release, after browser slice validation. |
| D17 | PROPOSED | Repository name `gothic-whip-framework`; working label only. |
| D18 | CONFIRMED | Fully animated character, not a sliding/static graphic; every supported action and pose, including crouch, jumping, knockback, and death, needs complete animation. |
| D19 | PROPOSED | Interpret “crunch” as crouch and “knock off” as knockback/knockdown, as stated to the user. Detailed state inventory and frame counts are proposed in ANIMATION_SPEC.md. |

## Interview progression

1. Initial reference: modern HD Castlevania remake/remaster.
2. Expanded to a Konami character/style mixture.
3. Concrete example: Simon in Mario's world, which implies a broader crossover than Konami alone.
4. Narrowed to a platformer with Simon's whip and less agile jumping.
5. Gothic, dark, detailed horror; Octopath considered briefly as a visual reference.
6. Final refinement: primarily Castlevania, no visible pixels, and fully animated actions/poses.
7. Final identity answer: Simon Belmont in Castlevania’s world.

“All characters” is historical brainstorming, not the current slice requirement. The assistant's suggested bright illustrated world was not accepted and is superseded. No existing workspace project was selected or imported.

## How to resolve a decision

Record its ID, choice, reason, source of authority, affected documents/assets, and evidence needed. A contributor may refine a PROPOSED baseline with justification. A contributor must not claim a user confirmed an OPEN preference. If unanswered, retain the question and give a bounded recommendation.

## Amendments

### 2026-10-08 — identity (D02, D12), horror intensity (D13), target device (D14)

Recorded per "How to resolve a decision" above. All three resolutions are direct user statements dated 2026-10-08; they supersede the corresponding interview-era entries and are the resolving authority. D09 and all other entries are untouched.

**D02 / D12 — protagonist and world identity (SUPERSEDED)**
- Choice: the protagonist is an **original hunter in an original gothic world**. Castlevania remains a design reference for tone and mechanics only (whip-led combat, restrained jumping, dark gothic horror, no visible pixels). No Konami character, costume, name, or world element is used.
- Reason: D02's named-character identity cannot be licensed by this project, while D15 confirms public distribution (web build, later APK). The original identity had no lawful shipping path; the original-hunter identity does.
- Source of authority: user statement, 2026-10-08 ("Switch to an original hunter (shippable)").
- Affected documents: this ledger (D02, D12); follow-up wording pass still owed in `SPEC.md`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md`, `docs/ASSET_SPEC.md`, `prompts/ASSET_GENERATION.md`, `prompts/NEXT_LLM.md`, and the P0 row of `docs/WORK_PACKAGES.md` (enumerated in `docs/AUDIT.md` B1/B11 — not yet edited). D12's replacement deliverable — the original hunter design reference — belongs to P2 (art bible).
- Evidence needed: none for the decision itself. The P2 style pack must demonstrate the original design without franchise-derived elements; provenance recording per `docs/ASSET_SPEC.md` §6 applies to every asset.

**D13 — horror intensity (CONFIRMED)**
- Choice: the proposed treatment stands confirmed — dread, decay, silhouettes; **no explicit gore**, and no heavier direction.
- Reason: the user accepted the proposal as sufficient; the line is now fixed for art direction and asset review.
- Source of authority: user statement, 2026-10-08 ("that's fine, no need heavier").
- Affected documents: this ledger (D13); `docs/ART_DIRECTION.md` limits are now decidable in P2 against this line.
- Evidence needed: P2's art bible should state the enforceable limits (what counts as explicit gore) so asset review doesn't relitigate taste per asset.

**D14 — target device (CONFIRMED)**
- Choice: **iPhone 17, browser play in iOS Safari** is the target device/browser and a must-support requirement (not an exploratory check).
- Reason: user direction; fixes the anchor the performance hypotheses were missing.
- Source of authority: user statement, 2026-10-08.
- Affected documents: this ledger (D14); `docs/TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md` is **not** edited in this pass — its "agreed mid-range Android phone" performance anchor (60 fps, 95th-percentile frame ≤20 ms, ≤30 MiB cold payload, ≤12 s load) is superseded in substance and must be re-derived for iPhone 17 / iOS Safari as a P5 follow-up. The single-threaded web-export baseline (D10) aligns well with Safari constraints. Android APK remains DEFERRED (D16), unaffected.
- Evidence needed: P5 device/browser matrix plus on-device measurements (VALIDATION V5, V8) on the named hardware; nothing is validated until those run.

### 2026-10-08 — stomp rule (D09), texture amendment (R1), proposed baselines (R3)

**D09 — stomp vs contact (CONFIRMED)**
- Choice: **no stomp kills. Contact with an enemy — including landing on one — hurts the hunter. The whip is the only weapon.**
- Reason: the whip is the defined combat verb; spacing and strike timing stay the skill test, per SPEC §2.
- Source of authority: user statement, 2026-10-08 ("no stomp. whip is the weapon").
- Affected documents: this ledger (D09); `docs/GAMEPLAY_RULES.md` already assumes this baseline and needs no revision. `docs/AUDIT.md` B3 closes.
- Evidence needed: none for the decision itself.

**R1 — texture amendment (RATIFIED under delegated judgement, 2026-10-08)**
- Choice: [TEXTURE_BUDGET.md](TEXTURE_BUDGET.md) §5 is ratified together with [TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) §2's import settings: slice art atlases ship **without mip chains** (linear filtering, sRGB, lossless), and texture residency is budgeted by **peak concurrent page set ≤ 7 pages** (112.0 MiB peak against the 128 MiB budget, 16.0 MiB headroom).
- Reason: without it the 128 MiB budget fails as written (170.7 MiB all-resident mipmapped).
- Source of authority: user delegation, 2026-10-08 ("use your judgement" on the ratification question). This records the assistant's judgement exercised at the user's direction — it is a ratification, not the user having personally reviewed the atlas arithmetic.
- Affected documents: this ledger (recorded alongside D11); [TEXTURE_BUDGET.md](TEXTURE_BUDGET.md) §5; [TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](TECHNICAL_SPEC.md) §2; [READINESS_REVIEW.md](READINESS_REVIEW.md) §4 R1. The 128 MiB figure in [TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md](TECHNICAL_CONSTRAINTS.md) is unchanged — the amendment reconciles delivery with it rather than rewriting it.
- Evidence needed: remains **unvalidated** until VALIDATION V2/V8 re-run the occupancy arithmetic on real packed art. The §6 sensitivity warning stands (trims 10 points worse → 144 MiB → budget breaks; resize policy would then be the next lever).

**R3 — proposed baselines D07–D11 (CONFIRMED under delegated judgement, 2026-10-08)**
- Choice: the PROPOSED baselines stand confirmed as tunable baselines: slice shape (D07), controls (D08), the (now confirmed) contact rule (D09), engine baseline (D10 as pinned to Godot 4.7.2-stable), view/grid/density (D11).
- Reason: the values are internally consistent and arithmetically proven compatible on paper (AUDIT, P6 sweep); changing them now would reopen proven work without new evidence.
- Source of authority: user delegation, 2026-10-08 ("use your judgement" on the baselines question). Assistant's judgement exercised at the user's direction, same caveat as R1.
- Affected documents: this ledger (D07, D08, D10, D11 move from PROPOSED to confirmed-as-baseline); derived [P1 proposal]/[P4 proposal] numbers in GAMEPLAY_RULES.md and STAGE_DESIGN.md become tunable baselines rather than open questions — each still individually revisable on greybox evidence (VALIDATION V6) without reopening the baselines.
- Evidence needed: greybox playtest evidence (V6) is the intended check on the derived numbers; no document work remains.

## Highest-value remaining questions

1. Which exact Simon costume/incarnation is the canonical visual reference? — **Answered by supersession 2026-10-08** (see Amendments): the reference is now an original hunter design, to be created in P2.
2. What horror intensity and minimum phone must this support? — **Answered 2026-10-08** (see Amendments): dread/decay/silhouettes, no explicit gore; iPhone 17 with iOS Safari.

No user questions remain open. D09 was the last one — resolved 2026-10-08 ("no stomp. whip is the weapon"). The texture amendment (R1) and proposed baselines (R3) were ratified/confirmed the same day under user-delegated judgement ("use your judgement") — see Amendments.

### 2026-10-09 — sprite scale normalization (production fix; no product-requirement change)

Recorded after the user's bug report of 2026-10-09 (hero changes size while moving). This amendment defines one shared number that production needed and corrects a false production claim; it changes no confirmed requirement.

**Crouch design height (new authoritative value)**
- Choice: the hero crouch family (crouch_enter/idle/exit, attack_crouch) renders at **140 source px = 0.625 × the 224 px standing height**. Standing remains 224 px (D11's 112 u at 2× density, unchanged).
- Reason: the crouch collision (60 u vs 104 u standing, ratio 0.577) and the briefs ("well below the standing silhouette", ASSET_BRIEFS S2) bound the choice; 140 sits inside the 0.60–0.65 band. Anchored on the crouched end frame for crouch_enter/exit.
- Source of authority: production fix under the 2026-10-08 full-production assignment; user-visible defect reported 2026-10-09.
- Affected documents: this ledger; `game/art/manifest.json` (`scale_fix_2026_10_09`); `game/art/SCALE_AUDIT_BEFORE.md` / `SCALE_AUDIT_AFTER.md`; `docs/REVIEW_RECORD.md` (scale-fix entry).

**Correction of record**
- The 2026-10-08 production claim "one uniform anchor scale per actor (no per-frame drift)" was wrong in effect: per-clip generation scale drift survived the anchor (walk −14%, crouch taller than standing, several clips clipped at the canvas edge), compounded by detached debris inflating bounding boxes. The fix (per-clip uniform scale from the figure's largest-component heights, debris-aware placement) and its before/after measurements are recorded in the manifest and audits above; the original notes are preserved and corrected, not rewritten.
